You can also Cast without connecting to the device Wirelessly, just click on cast after connecting to the device to your PC Via USB.

*After connecting you might get a message on the device to accept the connection, Check the Remeber PC checkbox and aprove the connection.

The Idea for this came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbRIWfaClE.
